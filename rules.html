                <p>Volleyball is played by two teams, each with six players on the court. The objective is to send the ball over the net and ground it on the opponent's side while preventing the same from happening on your side.</p>
                <p>Each team is allowed up to three touches to return the ball across the net. A player cannot hit the ball twice in succession (except when blocking).</p>
                <p>A rally begins with a serve and continues until the ball touches the ground, goes "out," or a team fails to return it properly.</p>

                <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/random/600x300/?scoreboard" alt="Volleyball Scoreboard">
                <p>Modern volleyball uses a rally point system where points are awarded on every rally, regardless of which team served.</p>
                <p>Indoor volleyball matches are typically played as best of five sets. The first four sets are played to 25 points (must win by 2). If a fifth set is necessary, it's played to 15 points (must win by 2).</p>
                <p>Beach volleyball matches are typically best of three sets, with the first two sets played to 21 points and the deciding set (if necessary) played to 15 points. All sets require a two-point advantage to win.</p>

                <h2>Player Positions and Rotations</h2>
                <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/random/600x300/?volleyball-positions" alt="Volleyball Positions">
                <p>In indoor volleyball, there are six positions on the court, numbered 1-6:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Position 1: Right back (server)</li>
                    <li>Position 2: Right front</li>
                    <li>Position 3: Middle front</li>
                    <li>Position 4: Left front</li>
                    <li>Position 5: Left back</li>
                    <li>Position 6: Middle back</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Players must rotate clockwise when their team wins the serve. However, after the serve, players can move to their specialized positions (setter, outside hitter, middle blocker, opposite, libero).</p>

                <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/random/600x300/?volleyball-referee" alt="Volleyball Referee">
                <ul>

                    <li><strong>Double contact:</strong> A player hits the ball twice in succession (except when blocking)</li>

                    <li><strong>Net fault:</strong> A player touches the net during play</li>
                    <li><strong>Foot fault:</strong> A server steps on or over the service line when serving</li>

                <p>While the Fédération Internationale de Volleyball (FIVB) standardizes rules for international competition, some regional variations exist:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>USA:</strong> In collegiate volleyball, teams can make 15 substitutions per set (different from FIVB's 6 substitutions)</li>
                    <li><strong>Brazil:</strong> The Brazilian Superliga sometimes uses experimental rules before they're adopted internationally</li>
                    <li><strong>Asia:</strong> Some Asian leagues allow a "technical timeout" when the leading team reaches 8 and 16 points in a set</li>
                    <li><strong>Snow Volleyball:</strong> Played in alpine countries, typically with 3 players per team on a snow court</li>
