                <p>Volleyball was invented in 1895 by William G. Morgan, a YMCA physical education director in Holyoke, Massachusetts. He created the game as a less intense alternative to basketball for older members of the YMCA.</p>
                <p>Morgan originally called the game "mintonette," but it was soon renamed "volleyball" because the main objective was to volley the ball back and forth over the net.</p>

                <p>The first official volleyball ball was designed in 1900. By 1916, the rules for spiking and back row attacks were established. The sport quickly spread internationally, with Canada being the first country outside the United States to adopt the game in 1900.</p>
                <p>During World War I, American soldiers introduced volleyball to Europe. By 1920, the Philippines had developed the "bomba" or "Filipino bomb," which was the forerunner of the modern spike.</p>
                <p>In 1947, the Fédération Internationale de Volleyball (FIVB) was founded in Paris, France, which helped standardize the rules internationally.</p>
