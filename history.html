                <p>Volleyball was invented in 1895 by William G. Morgan, a physical education director at the YMCA in Holyoke, Massachusetts. Morgan created the game as an indoor alternative to basketball, which had been invented just four years earlier.</p>
                <p>The original name for the sport was "Mintonette," but it was quickly changed to "volleyball" after a spectator remarked that the players seemed to be volleying the ball back and forth.</p>
